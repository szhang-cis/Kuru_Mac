**Florence** is a Python-based computational framework for multi-physics simulations using the finite element and boundary element methods.

# Features
A non-exhaustive list of core features:
- High order planar and curved finite and boundary elements (line, tri, quad, tet, hex)
- In-built CAD-conformal curvilinear mesh generator
- Powerful in-built pre and post processor with the ability to visualise high order curved meshes
- Poisson, electrostatic and heat transfer solvers
- Linear, geometrically linearised and fully nonlinear solid/structural mechanics solvers
- Linear, geometrically linearised and fully nonlinear electromechanics solvers
- Implicit and explicit dynamic solvers with contact formulation
- Generic monolithic, staggered and multigrid solvers for coupled multiphysics driven problems
- Strain gradient and micropolar elasticity and electro-elasticty solvers
- A suite of advanced hyperelastic, electrostatic and electro-hyperelastic material models
- Ability to read/write mesh/simulation data to/from gmsh, Salome, GID, Tetgen, obj, FRO, VTK and HDF5
- Support for heterogeneous computing using SIMD, shared parallelism, cloud-based parallelism and cluster-based parallelism
- Interfaces to a suite of sparse direct and iterative solvers including MUMPS, Pardiso, Petsc and hypre

In addition, the framework also provides Python interfaces to many low-level numerical subroutines written in C, C++ and Cython.

# Platform support
Florence supports all major operating systems including Linux, macOS and Windows (under Cygwin/MinGW) under
- Python 2.7
- Python >= 3.5
- PyPy >= v5.7.0


# Dependencies
The following packages are hard dependencies
- [Fastor](https://github.com/romeric/Fastor):          Data parallel (SIMD) FEM assembler
- cython
- numpy
- scipy

The following packages are optional (but recommended) dependencies
- [PostMesh](https://github.com/romeric/PostMesh):      High order curvilinear mesh generator
- pyevtk
- matplotlib
- mayavi
- scikit-umfpack
- pyamg
- psutil
- h5py

In addition, it is recommended to have an optimised BLAS library such as OpenBLAS or MKL installed and configured on your machine.

# Installation
## The easy way
using pip

```
pip install Florence
```

For pip installation to work you need to have `Fastor` installed. You can achieve this by

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/romeric/Fastor
mv Fastor/ /usr/local/include/Fastor/
```

It is also a good practice to set your compilers before pip installing florence

```
export CC=/path/to/c/compiler
export CXX=/path/to/c++/compiler
```

## Building from source
Have a look at `travis.yml` file for directions on installing florence's core library. First install `cython`, `numpy` and `scipy`. Download `Fastor` headers and place them under their default location `/usr/local/include/Fastor`

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/romeric/Fastor
mv Fastor/ /usr/local/include/Fastor/
```

Then installation of the core library is as easy as

```
git clone https://github.com/romeric/florence
cd florence
python setup.py build
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/florence:$PYTHONPATH"
```

This builds many low-level cython modules, ahead of time. Options can be given to `setup.py` for instance

```
python setup.py build BLAS=mkl CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++ CC=~/LLVM/clang
```

By default, florence builds in parallel using all the machine's CPU cores. To limit the build process to a specific number of cores, use the `np` flag for instance, for serial build one can trigger the build process as

```
python setup.py build np=1
```

## Configuring MUMPS direct sparse solver
Florence can automatically switch to `MUMPS` sparse direct solver if available. To install `MUMPS`, the easiest way is to use `homebrew` on macOS and `linuxbrew` on linux:

```
brew install mumps --without-mpi --with-openblas
git clone https://github.com/romeric/MUMPS.py
cd MUMPS.py
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

And whenever `MUMPS` solver is needed, just open a new terminal window/tab and do (this is the default setting for linuxbrew)
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib
```

## Configuring Pardiso direct sparse solver
The direct sparse solver shipped with `MKL`, `Pardiso` can be used if `MKL` is available. Both Anaconda and Intel distribution for python ship these.
If `MKL` is installed, the low-level FEM assembler in florence is also automatically linked to it during compilation, as long as "`BLAS=mkl`" flag is issued to `setup.py`.

```shell
conda install -c haasad pypardiso
```
We typically do not recommed adding `anaconda/bin` to your path. Hence, whenever `MKL` features or `Pardiso` solver is needed, just open a new terminal window/tab and type

```
export PATH="/path/to/anaconda2/bin:$PATH"
```

# Philosophy
Florence follows scipy's philosophy of providing a high level pythonic interface to finite element analysis of partial differential equations. It is a light weight library that depends only on the most ubiquitous python packages namely numpy, scipy and cython. Yet it is aimed to deliver high performance numerical computations on a range modern architectures. It is backend is designed to be configurable for plugging new solvers such as Petsc's and hypre's parallel solvers.

# Documentation
Documentation is available under [wiki](https://github.com/romeric/florence/wiki) pages. Furthermore, a series of well explained examples are provided in the example folder that cover most of the functionality of florence.

To get a quick taste of Florence, let us consider the Laplacian for example. Setting up and solving the Laplace equation using fourth order hexahedral Lagrange shape functions over a cube is as simple as

~~~python
import numpy as np
from Florence import *


def simple_laplace():
    """An example of solving the Laplace equation using
        fourth order hexahedral elements on a cube
    """

    # generate a linear hexahedral mesh on a cube
    mesh = Mesh()
    mesh.Cube(element_type="hex", nx=6, ny=6, nz=6)
    # generate the corresponding fourth order mesh
    mesh.GetHighOrderMesh(p=4)

    # set up boundary conditions
    def dirichlet_function(mesh):
        # create boundary flags - nan values would be treated as free boundary
        boundary_data = np.zeros(mesh.nnode)+np.NAN
        # potential at left (Y=0)
        Y_0 = np.isclose(mesh.points[:,1],0)
        boundary_data[Y_0] = 0.
        # potential at right (Y=1)
        Y_1 = np.isclose(mesh.points[:,1],mesh.points[:,1].max())
        boundary_data[Y_1] = 10.

        return boundary_data

    boundary_condition = BoundaryCondition()
    boundary_condition.SetDirichletCriteria(dirichlet_function, mesh)

    # set up material
    material = IdealDielectric(mesh.InferSpatialDimension(), eps=2.35)
    # set up variational form
    formulation = LaplacianFormulation(mesh)
    # set up solver
    fem_solver = FEMSolver(optimise=True)
    # solve
    results = fem_solver.Solve( boundary_condition=boundary_condition,
                                material=material,
                                formulation=formulation,
                                mesh=mesh)

    # write results to vtk file
    results.WriteVTK("laplacian_results")
